    The story of how Cristina and Zachary met and fell for eachother, and
    the people who will be at their sides on their wedding day.
---
It all started when Cristina and Zach briefly met at Chris's house one summer
before they all went back to school.

That year, Zach kept finding reasons to visit Chris at UMBC (he swears his
laptop was broken), and Cristina kept finding reasons to call Zach from Chris's
phone. Cristina and Zach started dating that year, and the rest is history!

### The proposal

Cristina and Zach had been dating five years before the proposal. Cristina is
very much a planner, and routinely planned out her weeks in advance, making
Zach's surprise proposal planning difficult. Zach saw his opportunity when
Cristina wanted to take a day off of work to do something fun and relaxing.

On May 13<sup>th</sup>, 2015, Cristina and Zach woke up early and set off for
a hike at Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park. Zach knew this was one
of Cristina's favorite places since her family would take yearly visits
there. The two reached a beautiful overlook during their hike and stopped
to have lunch. While they were enjoying the views, Zach asked Cristina to
marry him.

As Zach likes to joke, it definitely was not the graceful, eloquent proposal
speech everyone sees in the movies, but it got the job done. Exact details of
what happened next are a little blurry, as both of them were overcome with
emotion.

Cristina and Zach are very excited to get married, and look forward to their
future together!
